### Luke Schmitt (he/him)

I'm a Robotics Software Engineer for [@Interbotix](https://github.com/Interbotix) where I get to work on open source software for robotic platforms ranging from hobbyist and educational all the way to industrial. I primarily work on ROS-compatible platforms using C++ and Python. [Take a look at what we have to offer](https://www.trossenrobotics.com/)!

I have a Master's in Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University where I worked on mobile robotics and AI/ML applied to tethered UAV control. I learned a ton about robotics during my two years there and I'm happy to share any knowledge I gained along the way.
